# Bitcoin-Mining-with-Python
Bitcoin mining is a computation-intensive process that uses complicated computer code to generate a secure cryptographic system. The aim of this project is to show the working of Bitcoin Mining. Bitcoin mining ensures that blocks of transactions are created and stacked in the right order in a way that can be traced and proven mathematically.
Technology used- SHA-256
